# Giving Up

There are a lot of things that I do not want to do. I do them still. I do not entirely know why. I want to give them up.

## Food

There is much food that I find disgusting...Yet I eat it because well I need to eat.. or I'm with people that want to eat certain foods. 


### Street Food

So this trend of eating at taco trucks or food trucks was fun to follow along with years ago... but I am tired of getting sick.  I do not want to eat spoiled meat.. or old veggies. I do not care if it is less expensive.

### Meat

I mostly want to stop eating meat. I am close to doing so now, but I still find that I do not eat enough protein. Yesterday I bought a rotisserie chicken to supplement my nutrition.  I do not want to eat meat because I feel terrible that the animals live in horrible conditions only to be slaughtered for my benefit. It feels wrong.. very wrong. 

### Dairy

I need the protein, but I need to find a way to consume dairy from ethical farms.

### Fish

I am not sure about how to eat fish. I think they feel pain like any other thing.  I do not want to contribute to that. However, I need protein.  Maybe try for the least bad option? This feels like a cop out though. It is as it is. There is no least bad. It just is. 

### Grains and Veggies and Produce

So I'm left with grains and veggies and produce. So now what? I'd like to limit my intake to providers that do not harm the environment. I do not know how to do this.  


### Fast Food

I am giving it up. I do not care if it is the cheaper and easier option. I cannot eat it anymore. 

### Why? 

I think that the environment is a gift that should be conserved. Animals too should be treated with dignity and respect.  There are consequences to abusing an ecosystem... that humanity is a part of.. even if we attempt to separate ourselves from it. 

## The Internet

So the internet is incredible. It is also horrible.  I have access to information that has enabled to me learn skills that provide a living. That said, there is a ton of toxic content online that I do not want to consume. 

### Porn

I am a millennial man that has had access to pornography since I have wanted to view it. I admit it is still appealing.. even at 30 years old.  I have had periods of my life where I have abstained... then there are periods of my life when I have not.  Regardless, the damage is done.  The way I look at women.. and men is tainted by the exhibits I have seen online.  I wish this was not the case.. but it is.. Sex is fetishized. Sometimes does not feel like something natural.. or really that enjoyable.. It feels like an act done to satisfy a desire to replicate what we've seen online. It can feel like it is a desire to satisfy a fear of missing out. That is fucked. 

### Youtube

There is some great content on youtube. I have learned a lot.  That said, everyone is trying to sell something. I do not like that.  I do not want to watch some guy review "products" to encourage me to buy them. I do not want to watch some guy tell me that Trump or Biden is corrupt in order to drive engagement. I do not want to watch reels that affirm some ugly biases. I guess I should let it go. Though I really do not want to. 

### Instagram

Fuck Insta.. I like being able to connect with my friends, but the reels feature.. the discover feature.. etc is just so toxic that I cannot use the application. I want to post. I might find a way to do this without using the application... I want to connect but I do not want to consume. 

### Twitter

I do not really use twitter at all anyways.. but the few times i've logged in... well damn

### Propaganda

I do not like reading the news, but this is my addiction. Whenever I have down time I check google news to read tabloids. I think the news and journalism is important.. but I do not like to consume garbage. I might have to create my own crawler for valid information.  I found this.. I should try it https://github.com/stringer-rss/stringer

### Enshitification in general

The business model of content production encourages bad behavior. I want to avoid them all. 

## Being Cheap

I hate being cheap. I unfortunately inherited an illness in which I will buy things that I do not need regularly... when it comes to buying things I need.. I try to save money... ending up disappointed.  I think it is called saving a penny to lose a dime or something like that.  

There is no real reason for me to do this.  I do not want to be ripped off, but I also do not want to settle with garbage. I think there is a healthy middle ground.  I just need to find it. 

### Shoes

Cheap shoes suck. Cheap materials suck. 

### Clothing

Same.. Cheap stuff sucks. It is not comfortable.. it does not fit correctly. It is ugly. Moving on

### Tools

Same.. No more cheap tools that break themselves or break everything else


## Clothing

I do not like dressing like a bum.  I had considered this phrase to be snobby... and it is.. but the way I dress affects the people around me. I think pretending that dress does not matter in a social setting is absurd. I do not think I can escape social pressure. What is right or wrong is socially determined. 

### T Shirts

I will not wear t shirts in public.  I know that it is appropriate in some settings.. and maybe in those settings I will be more adaptable.. Though in most cases I will not wear t shirts in public. 

### Athletic Wear

This is a bit of a reflection on the fitness industry in general. Much of the gear I need in my daily life does not need to be technical.  That said polyester and Nylon are incredible materials that are incredibly durable and do not directly harm animals. I think there is place for them in certain settings.  However, most of the time technical clothing is overkill.  I need to think this through.  I am aware of the damage microplastics do to the environment. I need to research more to better understand what else I can manage.  

### Exposed Skin

I am too old to be thirst trapping. I really mean this. I do not need to wear halfway unbuttoned shirts, short sleeves, nor shorts. I fear sun exposure that is part of it, but also it is somewhat unnecessary to show my chest and legs. 

## Footwear

I want my footwear to be up to the task, be durable, and repairable. I do not want to single use shoes... nor do I want to expose my feet to the environment. 

### Sandals/flippies

Sandals and flip flops like t shirts are acceptable in certain settings.  That said, most of the time I do not want to see peoples' feet. I do not want to see dirty toes.. nor do I want to expose the environment to sweat and grime.  So no sandals for me. 

### Sneakers

Sneakers too are acceptable in a number of settings.  I am conflicted with the idea of a sneaker. I think the aggressive running shoes and poorly constructed garbage that I typically would buy for the gym should not be worn in public. There are some well made low rise shoes I think I will buy. They are made of leather and can be repaired. I do not want to use the extremely limited use plastic items available to me. 


## Single Use Stuff

So yeah in certain settings (like everything) a single use option is probably the least bad.. but in most cases I do no think this is the case. 

### Plastic Utensils

I carry my own utensils and knives.. I do not need to use plastic trash

### Paper Towels

I am not sure about this one. I have a ton of rags that I keep on hand to clean up after myself.. That said I do not really know if using a cotton product multiple times is really better than using a paper product once. 

### Plastic Bags

I keep my bags and use them for garbage. This works pretty well.  If I am going to use plastic at least use the free-ish stuff at home

## Expensive Technology

I have had a habit of wanting to purchase the most bleeding edge computers and smartphones.. In truth I don't really need them

### Computers

I can buy refurbished computers for my use case. I mean most of the workloads I would need to run can be run in a cloud environment now. There is no need for me really to own a power machine. 

### Phones

My smartphones need to be able to handle the following without a problem. With these.. I am good

1. Google Maps
2. Video Calls
3. Messaging apps
4. Email
5. Banking
6. Chrome

## Recreation

### Camping

I will no longer camp just to camp. I will camp out to achieve some sort of goal that I really want to do.. But I will not willingly camp out just for the fun of it. It does not really do it for me. 

### Cabins in the woods

I do not want to be isolated from society. I do not want to make all of my own meals.. my coffee... etc. I want to be around people and I want amenities. It is not worth it for me to disappear into the woods. Society is nice

### Climbing

I think I am done hanging out a rock gym.... or even the crag.  I can see this being fun as a way to challenge myself when I have little to do.. but for it to be my personality... Yeah I am done with that

### Television and Streaming

I think television is a waste of time. It truly hurts my mind. I think there are some beautiful films and maybe some tv shows.  I struggle to find them. I think I will only purchase those that I appear to be beautiful. The others can be forgotten.

### Road Trips

I am done with road trips. I do not like driving for more than 20 minutes. I do not like using sketchy bathrooms. I do not like eating the gross food of the road.  There are occasions where this is probably necessary... But I will try to plan accordingly to avoid this.

### Not Planning Trips

I used to find it fun to just go.. .to do things without a real plan. I hate it now. I want to at least have an outline so that  I can do the things that I want to do rather than idly wasting time. 

### Tourism in General

I do not really like the idea of tourism. It feels like a gross industry in which I spend money to experience a curated experience. What will I really experience in Italy that I will not experience in my daily life?  Maybe I won't drive.. or eat different food.. Sure, but just spending the money to go overseas to see the world feels like a weird fantasy. I would like to go to connect to friends.. or learn a skill.. but just going.. I think I'm good. 

## Daily Stuff

The daily stuff is the most important stuff. The little things... yeah the little things of my every day life are the most important things. 

### Multi-tasking

I will avoid multi-tasking. I end up half-assing multiple things. 

### Poor Organization

Organization reduces friction. Fast retrieval is a god send. When I know where my things are I can save time and energy. Putting in the energy to mindfully place my things for easier retrieval is worth it. 

### Messiness

I do not like being in messy environments. Dirt grosses me out sure... but I also do not want to be in an environment with clutter and waste.  

### Poor Hygiene

Hygiene is very important.  I will create a complete section for this... but the point being is that it is important to reduce the likelihood of illness, rot, and decay.

### Waste

Producing waste is gross. I want to minimize how much garbage I generate.. and how much garbage I consume. 

## Social Behaviors

I am bound to my social environment. Almost everything I have written relates back to it. This section is more about communication than anything else I would say. 

### Sending the Wrong Signals

So the way I dress, my hair, my pitch.. everything sends a message to other people in my environment. I do not want to send messages that invite responses that I do not want.  Yeah of course this is an incredibly hard task, butI will try. 

### Over Sharing

I do not like to share too many personal things about my life with people that I do not know nor trust.  In day to day life people will ask about my day.. or the food I am eating.. TBH I do not want to tell you.. so I smile and say a little white lie. It is a good social strategy.. But in other cases I have felt that I have to share.  I am going to be more strategic to avoid having to in the future. 

### Feeling Pressured to Drink

I do not like to drink alcohol. I think it is a norm in the US to drink rather heavily. I will avoid spending time with people that drink. 

### Feeling Pressured to Eat Bad Food

Again the same as above. I guess I will have to be more selective of the situations I place myself in. 

### Feeling Pressured to Have Sex

Well, I've written about porn.. here we go. I have felt pressured to have sex when I feel uncomfortable.  I am in a space where I feel badly about having sex for pleasure.. or maybe its about having sex just for the sake of having sex.  I am not sure how to describe my feelings. I just feel like I've been pressured... by both sexes despite not really wanting to be intimate. So I'm going to give that up. 

## Time

So there is a movie called the Great Beauty  The premise of the film is that everything is bs -or at least that is my take away. I would say the most meaningful part of the film is when the protagonist tells the audience that he is too old to do thing he does not want to do. I like that. I am going to try to live by that. 


## Idols

I think idolization is a sin. Simply a sin. An infraction against my own life. ( I am trying to think of a word that is equal to sin, but without the religious undertones.. but I give up. Simply a sin)  I do not want to idolize priests, politicians, influencers, or even ideas.. I do not want to escape my reality by believing in false narratives.

### Super Heroes

I am tired of super heroes and shonen protagonists.  I am tired of idolizing characters like Goku and Wolverine that do not exist. I am not a child. Reality is not an anime.

### Politicians 

Politicians might actually care.. They might actually try to create a better world.  I do not know. I do not want to place my hope in them though. I want to improve my own life.. but I need to live in an environment in which that is possible.  I guess I have to deal with this.. and maybe its a blessing that I even have a choice to.. 

### Musicians

I let this go a long time ago. They are just musicians. They are just people. 

### Athletes

I can respect an athlete... but they too must be judged by their character.
